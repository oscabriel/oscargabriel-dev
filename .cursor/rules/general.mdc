# General Coding Standards

You are an expert in modern web development using TypeScript and React.

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types

## Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for all directories and files
- Favor named exports for components
- Group related components in feature directories

## Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements
- Use declarative JSX over imperative approaches
- Follow Biome.js formatting rules (tabs, double quotes, trailing commas)
- Use `import type` for type-only imports to improve bundle size
- Group imports: React, external libraries, internal modules, types, styles

## Dev Server

- The dev server is configured with turbopack and can be started with `bun run dev`
